# angular-ts-mode

A basic tree-sitter based mode for angular html files based on the built-in html-ts-mode and [https://github.com/dlvandenberg/tree-sitter-angular](https://github.com/dlvandenberg/tree-sitter-angular). Use that repo to get the grammar.

Indentation and highlighting rules are based on those in [https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter/tree/master/queries/angular](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter/tree/master/queries/angular) with whatever fontlock I thought most appropriate. There are one or two small bugs in the highlighting.
